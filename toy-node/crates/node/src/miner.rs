//! Block production.
//!
//! The miner runs one loop forever: assemble a candidate block from the mempool,
//! execute it, hunt for a nonce that satisfies the difficulty, then commit it as
//! the new chain head. Every block is mined, including empty ones — an idle
//! proof-of-work chain still burns electricity to keep extending itself, and the
//! block reward is the incentive to keep doing so.
//!
//! The important structural detail is *when the lock is held*. Mining can take
//! many seconds, and holding the state lock through it would freeze every RPC
//! request. So the miner snapshots the state, releases the lock, does its hashing,
//! and only re-acquires the lock for the instant it takes to commit.
